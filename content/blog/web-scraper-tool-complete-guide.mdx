Web scraping has become an essential skill for businesses, researchers, and developers who need to extract valuable data from websites at scale. Our Web Scraper Tool simplifies this process, making professional-grade data extraction accessible to everyone.

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software tools. Instead of manually copying and pasting information, web scraping tools can collect thousands of data points in minutes, transforming unstructured web data into structured, usable formats.

### Why Use Our Web Scraper Tool?

Our web scraper stands out with its intuitive interface and powerful capabilities:

- **CSS Selector Support**: Target specific elements with precision

- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting for debugging

## How to Use the Web Scraper Tool

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Enter the Target URL**
   - Paste the website URL you want to scrape
   - Ensure the URL is accessible and properly formatted

2. **Define CSS Selectors**
   - Use CSS selectors to target specific elements
   - Examples: `h2` for headings, `.price` for price elements, `#content` for specific IDs

3. **Execute the Scrape**
   - Click "Scrape" to start the extraction process
   - View results in an organized, expandable format

4. **Analyze Results**
   - Review extracted text content
   - Examine HTML attributes and metadata
   - Export data for further processing

### CSS Selector Examples

```css
/* Extract all article titles */
h1, h2, h3

/* Get product prices */
.price, [data-price]

/* Capture contact information */
.contact-info, .email, .phone
